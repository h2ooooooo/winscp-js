# @jalsoedesign/winscp-core

Read WinSCP INI settings, registry sessions and registry exports, including transfer profiles and SSH tunnels. Supported internal password formats can be decoded explicitly; external/master-password blobs remain locked.

## Install and read profiles

~~~sh
npm install @jalsoedesign/winscp-core
npm install --global @jalsoedesign/winscp-cli
~~~

~~~ts
import {WinScpProfileSource} from '@jalsoedesign/winscp-core';

const source = await WinScpProfileSource.fromFile('WinSCP.ini');
console.log(source.list());
~~~

~~~sh
winscp-js sources --json
winscp-js list --file WinSCP.ini --json
winscp-js search example --file WinSCP.ini
winscp-js get work --file WinSCP.ini --json
~~~

Node 22.22.2 or newer is required. Read commands do not change application settings. Discovery reports candidate storage; ambiguous installations require explicit selection. Windows-native storage and process discovery require Windows. See --help for the application's file, directory, registry and installation options.

Normalized profiles and default CLI output contain metadata and credential references. getNativeSettings() explicitly returns native settings and may contain secrets. --show-password requests supported credential resolution; unsupported encryption is reported without fabricating a password.

## Write and sync

write and sync create previews. apply is a separate operation; write-status checks availability without mutation. Existing profiles require explicit update/upsert mode, repeated on apply. Stored passwords, key contents and host trust policies are not copied. Unknown native settings are preserved where supported, and unsupported conversions are refused.

Built-in apply requires Windows. Writers recheck revisions, application processes and known lock markers. Files use exclusive handles and protected recovery backups. Registry writes default to native transactions and refuse unavailable capability. Explicit --registry-mode guarded enables checks, backups and conditional rollback without atomicity; select it for both preview and apply. Keep the application and other settings writers closed. There is no force or lock bypass.

[Writing policies, format boundaries and recovery](https://github.com/h2ooooooo/portline/blob/main/docs/profile-writing.md).

Portline manages profiles, selection, credential references and guarded settings changes. This repository supplies the application adapter and executable. Dockline provides separate SSH, transfer and key operations.

## Development

Use the repository development guide for independent builds and packed-consumer checks. Build scripts do not locate or build sibling checkouts.

## Shared connection execution

WinSCP supplies native settings and normalized Portline connection definitions. Install the optional
`@jalsoedesign/portline-dockline` integration and the Dockline client for the operation you need:
`dockline-ftp-client` for FTP/FTPS, `dockline-sftp-client` for file transfers over SSH, or
`dockline-ssh-client` for SSH commands. The reader itself has no transport dependency.

Use the same shared bridge with any Portline source. Resolve only the selected connection's credentials;
configure host verification explicitly at runtime, or supply supported saved fingerprint metadata.
Listing profiles does not resolve credentials or connect. Saved tunnels remain explicit connection references;
the bridge refuses routes it cannot execute rather than bypassing them.

Native connection options that cannot be faithfully represented are exposed in `unsupportedOptions`.
The shared bridge refuses those definitions before connecting. Native settings remain available through the
reader; a metadata projection is not permission to ignore saved proxy, authentication or trust requirements.

After building the reader, run `npm run demo:execution` with the shared bridge installed to check a synthetic
native profile through the real configuration mapper. This smoke example opens no network connections and
checks that unsupported native settings are refused. It never prints resolved credentials.

For a real scoped session, select your saved profile and provide its password (when needed) and an independently
verified SSH host-key fingerprint through the environment. Install the matching Dockline client first.

```js
import {WinScpProfileSource} from '@jalsoedesign/winscp-core';
import {createDocklineBridge} from '@jalsoedesign/portline-dockline';

const source = await WinScpProfileSource.fromFile('WinSCP.ini');
const bridge = createDocklineBridge({source});

await bridge.withFiles('Production', async remote => {
    for await (const entry of remote.list('.')) {
        console.log(entry.path);
    }
}, {password: process.env.REMOTE_PASSWORD, hostFingerprint: process.env.SSH_HOST_KEY_SHA256});
```

The scope closes the connection after the callback, including on failure.

Relative private-key paths without a documented base directory require an explicit runtime `privateKeyPath`.
Unresolved native path macros are refused; the bridge never guesses a key path from the process working directory.

For complete source selection, language variants, runtime options and native-only refusal rules, use the
[connection execution guide](https://h2ooooooo.github.io/winscp-js/api/integration). SSH fingerprints must use
canonical SHA256 base64; trust callbacks never persist approval. The reader CLI gains no network commands.
