# API reference

The library package is `@jalsoedesign/winscp-core`. It exports `WinScpProfileSource`, its application alias, discovery helpers and `createWinScpWriter`. For complete parameter and return types, see [TypeScript signatures](/reference/types).

## Construct a source

| API | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `fromFile(filename)` | Load a supported configuration file asynchronously. |
| `fromRegistry(key?, reader?, view?)` | Read an explicit native Windows registry location; reader injection supports tests/importers. |
| `fromSessions(source, sessions)` | Construct from already parsed native records with source provenance. |
| `discover(options?)` | Return candidates, optional selectedSourceId and diagnostics without guessing among ambiguous sources. |
| `open(options?)` | Discover and open the explicitly selected or established source; unresolved ambiguity fails. |
| `decodeWinScpPassword(value, identity)` | Return available with a value, locked, or unsupported for the recognized saved format. |

## Read a source

| API | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `source.source` | Source identity, application and known storage/provenance metadata. |
| `source.list()` | A new array of normalized ConnectionProfile records. |
| `source.get(path)` | Exact canonical-path match or undefined. |
| `source.search(term, options?)` | Case-insensitive metadata matches; fields can be name or all. |
| `source.getNativeSettings(name)` | Native settings for an exact session; may contain secrets. |
| `source.resolve(reference)` | Explicit credential lookup with a typed state/value result. |

A ConnectionProfile includes id, name, path, source, connections and diagnostics. Connections distinguish SSH/SFTP, FTP/TLS, database and unsupported protocols. Authentication is a list of password references, key metadata, agent/interactive methods or explicit unsupported methods. SSH hops are referenced by connection ID through via.

## Writer factory

`createWinScpWriter(sourceReference, options?)` returns NativeProfileWriter. The source reference must select one destination storage location. Options include mode (create/update/upsert), allowLossy and registryMode where registry storage is supported. Trusted backend injection is available for host integrations; it is not a CLI lock bypass.

| Writer API | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `inspect()` | Destination revision, application/lock availability and diagnostics. |
| `plan(profiles)` | Redacted native-write preview; no settings mutation. |
| `planChanges(mutations)` | Preview explicit create/update/upsert/delete mutations. |
| `importPlan(document)` | Validate and reconstruct a serialized preview against current storage and the same policies. |
| `apply(preview)` | Recheck guards and commit the writer's valid preview. |
| `backupPaths` | Recovery backups retained by the last commit attempt. |

See [write and sync](/guide/writing) before applying any settings change.

## Optional shared execution APIs

`@jalsoedesign/portline-dockline` supplies `createDocklineBridge`, `DocklineBridge` and `ProfileExecutionError`. These are separate package exports, not exports of the native reader. Its `withFiles`, `withSsh`, `toConfig`, `toSshConfig` and `createFileAdapter` methods accept the normalized profiles described above. See [the actual source-to-session example and option table](/api/integration). Profile parsing stays metadata-only; execution and credential lookup are explicit.

### Normalized execution fields

The shared contract can represent the following fields. A reader emits only the native settings it can interpret faithfully; inspect `unsupportedOptions` and diagnostics before execution.

| Field | Meaning for the shared mapper |
| --- | --- |
| `connections[].id`, `kind`, `protocol`, `endpoint` | Exact connection selection and endpoint/capability validation. |
| `authentication` | Credential references, private-key metadata, agent selection, anonymous FTP or explicit unsupported methods. |
| `prompt-password` versus `interactive` | A password prompt differs from SSH keyboard-interactive authentication. |
| `filenameEncoding`, FTP `passive` and `tls` | Supported filename/FTP settings; ambiguous TLS requires a deliberate runtime choice. |
| SSH `trust.fingerprints` | Optional canonical SHA256 pin metadata, not permission to persist a trust decision. |
| `unsupportedOptions` | Native requirements that the shared bridge refuses rather than ignoring. |
| `via` | Saved SSH-hop relationships; the current shared execution bridge refuses automatic hop setup. |

These records are not raw Dockline configuration and contain no secret values. The shared mapper supplies executable configuration only when explicitly requested. Guarded writing remains a separate operation and does not copy runtime trust or authentication callbacks.
