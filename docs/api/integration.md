# Connect a selected profile

SFTP/FTP profile projection does not turn unsupported SCP, WebDAV or S3 settings into supported transfers. Dockline separately provides transport execution.

## Inspect the selected connection

```ts
const profile = source.get(selectedPath);

if (!profile) {
    throw new Error('Profile not found');
}

for (const connection of profile.connections) {
    console.log(connection.id, connection.protocol);
}

console.log(profile.diagnostics);
```


This fragment uses a source opened in the [quick start](/api/quick-start) and an exact returned path. Output depends on that native profile; it can contain more than one connection.

## Supply execution deliberately

A normalized Portline profile is not a Dockline configuration object. Your integration must select a supported connection, map its endpoint and options, choose explicit credential resolution and verify server identity. SSH-hop references describe relationships; they are not an automatically executed tunnel chain.

Use [Dockline's API documentation](https://h2ooooooo.github.io/dockline/api/) for generic transfers, SSH execution and key conversion. Do not pass an arbitrary profile directly to `Dockline.connect` or treat raw native settings as transport options. Portline's [connector registry](https://h2ooooooo.github.io/portline/reference/api) lets a host register its own providers; it is not a universal built-in mapper.

Read operations do not validate that a host is reachable, a key file exists or authentication will succeed. Unsupported metadata and diagnostics remain meaningful to your application.
